# Live BTC Implied Volatility Charts

Using LedgerX public websocket API we're able to demonstrate using Redis as a multipurpose datastore.
Using a server side Lua script to check the received updates counter we can appropriately publish PUBSUB messages to the
listening [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) app and store the bid/ask prices to a 
[RedisTimeSeries](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/) data type atomically.

The Bokeh app displays the implied volatility calculated from the best bid and offer prices received over websocket.
We're using the Black-Scholes formula implemented by the [vollib](http://vollib.org/) library.

We get the price of bitcoin from polling the coinbase API every 3 seconds.

This allows traders to do further analysis and find opportunities in possible mispricings in the volatility component of
the options pricing model.

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Run Redis container

```
 docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redislabs/redismod
```

Thhis will run both Redis and Redis modules like [RedisTimeSeries](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/)

### Step 2. Clone the repository

```
 git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/implied-vol-plot
```

### Step 3. Install the dependencies

Install the below dependencies in requirements.txt in venv

```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
```

### Step 4.  Execute the script

Run `ledgerx_ws.py` which is the script consuming the websocket stream from LedgerX 

```
 python3 ledgerx_ws.py
```

### Step 5. Run Bokeh server application

Run the below command from the project root to start up the Bokeh server application and open a web browser to
the local URL.

```bash
  bokeh serve --show iv_app.py
```

There are pre-cache files `contracts.pkl` and `id_table.json` which are loaded so no authenticated requests are needed.
If you have a LedgerX account and API key, you can create a file named `secret` with the API key on the first line which
will enable authenticated API queries.

## Using Docker

### Pre-requisite:
- Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

- Run the command to avoid background save failure under low memory condition

```bash
  sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1 
```

- Install docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

If you don't configure docker to be used without sudo you'll have to add sudo in front of any docker command

- To build image: 

```
 sudo docker build -t iv_app:dev .`
```

- To run image interactively, mapping port 5006 from the container to 5006 on your local machine:

`sudo docker run -it -p 5006:5006 -w "/implied-vol-plot" -v "$(pwd):/implied-vol-plot" iv_app:dev bash`

- To run it in the background in detached mode:

`sudo docker run -d -p 5006:5006 -w "/implied-vol-plot" -v "$(pwd):/implied-vol-plot" iv_app:dev`

### Using Docker-compose

- To start services: 
`docker-compose up` #can add -d flag to run in background

- To stop services: 

`docker-compose down`

To run a specific service interactively: 

`docker-compose exec <name-of-service-in-docker-compose-yaml> sh`
